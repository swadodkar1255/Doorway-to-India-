		  <h1>My Bucket List</h1>
		  
	      <p> This summer, I am planning to go to India to see my family. While I am there there are many thing that I hope to do:</p>
		  
		  <ul>
			  <li>Get snacks with my cousins</li>
		  	<li>Eat as many lychees and mangoes as I can</li>
			 <li>Go shopping for clothes with my Aunt because Indian clothes in America are crazy expensive</li>
			 <li>See what the American fast food chains are like there</li>
			 <li>Experience the  traffic</li>
			 <li>Get milk in a bag</li>
			  <li>Make at least one new friend</li>
		  </ul>

		<p>The image to the left shows one of my favorite fruits, lychee. Lychees are really expensive here but can be easily found in India. </p>

		 <h1>Family</h1>
	     
		<p><img src="images/cousins.JPG" width="300" height="219" alt=""/> This is me and sister with my cousins the last to last time we visited. I am in the pink and my sister has the braided pigtails. I have been to India three times so far. Once when I was a baby, so that does not really count. The second time is shown in the image. The last time was in the summer before 5th grade. I was too young to remeber much, which is why I want to go now so I can remember everything.</p>
